 Task 2 - Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
🎯 Task 2 Completed | Machine Learning Intern SkillCraft Technology 🚀
I’m thrilled to share that I’ve successfully completed the second task of my internship at SkillCraft Technology as a Machine Learning Intern! This time, the focus was on applying K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their behavioral data 🧠📊

🔍 Project Title:
“Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering”
📌 Key Highlights:
Analyzed Annual Income and Spending Score features
Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
Created clear visualizations to represent customer segments
Identified 5 unique customer groups to aid personalized marketing strategies

📊 This task helped me deepen my understanding of:
✔ Clustering algorithms
✔ Customer behavior analytics
